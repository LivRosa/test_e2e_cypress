# Study Project - Learning to Automate Tests with Cypress 🎓📚

## Objective 🎯

The objective of this project is my learning in test automation with Cypress. Through this project, I seek to acquire skills to write effective automated tests and ensure code quality.

## Pre-requirements 📋

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v16.13.2` and `8.3.2` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation ⚙️

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests 🔍

You can run the tests simulating a desktop or mobile viewport.

### Desktop 💻

Run `npm run cypress` to run the test in headless mode on a desktop viewport.

Or, run `npx cypress open` to open Cypress in interactive mode on a desktop viewport.

### Mobile 📲

Run `npm test` to run the test in headless mode on a mobile viewport.

Or, run `npm run cy:open:mobile` to open Cypress in interactive mode on a mobile viewport.

## Some Learnings 🌱

- Setting up a Cypress project from scratch ✔️
- Visiting local and remote pages ✔️
- Testing file uploads ✔️
- Running tests simulating the dimensions of a mobile device ✔️
- Creating basic documentation for the automated testing project ✔️
- Solving the same problems in different ways by understanding the Cypress API ✔️
